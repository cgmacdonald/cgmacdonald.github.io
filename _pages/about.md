I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at Princeton University, where my advisor is Dr. Yi Ming. My main area of interest is in large scale atmospheric dynamics, with a focus on tropical phenomenon such as convectively-coupled equatorial waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation and equatorial superrotation. I previously received my bachelor's degree in 2020 from the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where my focus was on mathematical physics. Before coming to Princeton, my previous research experience included time at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) where I worked with Dr. Ray Nassar and the University of Toronto where I worked with Prof. Debra Wunch on topics related to satellite observations of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide.
