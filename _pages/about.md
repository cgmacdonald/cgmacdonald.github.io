I am an Environmental Fellow at the [Harvard University Center for the Environment](https://www.environment.harvard.edu/) and the [Department of Earth and Planetary Science](https://eps.harvard.edu/), where my faculty advisor is Prog. Zhiming Kuang. I study the interplay between moist convection and the large-scale circulations of the atmosphere, such as the Hadley and Walker Cells in the tropics. 

I recently defended my Ph.D. in the [Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at Princeton University](https://aos.princeton.edu/), where my advisor was Dr. Yi Ming (Now a professor at Schiller Institute, Boston College). My main area of interest was in large-scale atmospheric dynamics, with a focus on tropical phenomena such as convectively-coupled equatorial waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and equatorial superrotation. For my Ph.D. I used a a combination of idealized general circulation models and simple theories to better understand these topics. I previously received my bachelor's degree in 2020 from the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where my focus was on mathematical physics. Before coming to Princeton, my previous research experience included time at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) where I worked with Dr. Ray Nassar and the University of Toronto where I worked with Prof. Debra Wunch on various topics related to satellite observations of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide.
