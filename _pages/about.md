I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science at Princeton University, where my advisor is Dr. Yi Ming (Now a professor at Schiller Institute, Boston College). My main area of interest is in large-scale atmospheric dynamics, with a focus on tropical phenomena such as convectively-coupled equatorial waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and equatorial superrotation. I try to use a combination of idealized general circulation models and simple theories to better understand these topics. I previously received my bachelor's degree in 2020 from the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where my focus was on mathematical physics. Before coming to Princeton, my previous research experience included time at Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) where I worked with Dr. Ray Nassar and the University of Toronto where I worked with Prof. Debra Wunch on various topics related to satellite observations of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. 

In September 2025, I will be starting a post-doctoral position as an Environmental Fellow at the Harvard University Center for the Environment, working with Prof. Zhiming Kuang.
